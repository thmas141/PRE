# PRE
# Code from my Internship at NTNU

- **`raw-codes/`** → contains all the scripts I used to obtain my results during the internship and for writing my report.  

- **`Clean-Version/`** → provides a more coherent and easier-to-understand structure. It includes fewer functions, but they are more useful and better organized. ⚠️ Since they were not extensively tested, some bugs may still remain.
